Iam a hobbyst beekeeper with 7+ years of exeperience. I work with 10 frame Dadant deeps + 1/2 shallow supers.

I am looking for a strategy that will allow me to maximize honey production in my location (northern Romania) with the main flow between April - June (sometimes middle of July). Main flow comes from: dandelions, urban mixed flora, catalpue, black locust, some horse chestnuts and linden trees. There is also a fruit tree flow in March but it's fickle.

I suspect there is an ideal brood nest size that will allow for an optimum amount of forager bees at the right time while also reducing swarming to minimum. I work with Buckfast queens crossed with indigenous Carniolan drones in the wild. One key metric that I want to explore and find out is this ideal nest size. Please do your research and provide an estimate with a high degree of confidence.

My current "ideal" brood nest size is 7 frames. What I plan to do is to use helper colonies that will be used for brood rearing only and I would take up to 3 frames of capped brood from them am the start of the flow and insert them into the production colonies. Since I don't want the existing brood space to expand I will use a dummy frame divider/excluder that will not allow the queen to reach them. Once the bees emerge I will take the frames out and replace them with new ones filled with capped brood.

Considering I plan to use 4-5 colonies for production and 2-3 for brood rearing devise a plan that will allow me to do this considering a normal fertility rate for queens that are maximum 2-3 years old. I am looking for weekly detailed instructions on how to approach this and what are the steps needed including Varroa treatment in late June, stimulative pollen subtitute feeding in August for brood and preparing for wintering of both colony types.

Once the plan is finished and laid out in detail generate a calendar in table format that will have each week on a different row and will summarize the activities while also showing the following indicators using a graphic: colony strenght measured in firager bees colony future strength measured in brood cells/frames honey flow strenght (level from 1-5) helper colony frame extraction readiness level

Since blooming and nectar flow for the species mentioned are relative to each other make sure to mark them on the calendar so that I can judge if the season is slower or faster than usual based on what I can see is actually happening. This will also help me predict what species are next to bloom and take appropriate action.

This is a powerful adaptation. Using a **12-frame Dadant (Dadant-Blatt)** split in half is actually superior to Thorsen’s original setup because the Dadant deep frame is larger, providing more stability and resources, and the 6-frame width allows for a dedicated internal feeder without cramping the queen.  
Here is the Thorsen Strategy adapted specifically for your **12-Frame Split Dadant "Biological Factory."**

### **1\. The Physical Configuration (The Factory)**

You are building a vertical factory. It is crucial to understand that you need **two deep boxes** (Brood Chambers) for this to work, not a brood box and a shallow super.

#### **Base Floor (The Engine Room)**

* **Box:** Standard 12-Frame Dadant Deep.  
* **Divider:** A solid, bee-tight vertical board in the exact center.  
* **Entrances:**  
  * **Side A (East):** 6 Frames.  
  * **Side B (West):** 6 Frames.  
  * *Note: Opposing entrances are excellent for reducing drifting.*

#### **The Queen Excluder**

* Place a metal queen excluder over the entire box. The queens **must** stay in the bottom 6-frame compartments.

#### **The Upper Deck (The Nursery)**

* **Box:** A second 12-Frame Dadant **Deep** Box (same depth as the bottom).  
* **Divider:** This box **must also have a divider** matching the bottom one.  
  * *Why?* Thorsen’s method relies on specific frame rotation. Keeping the two colonies separate in the upper deck prevents fighting and makes management easier.  
* **Cover:** A split inner cover or distinct feed holes so you can access one side without disturbing the other.

**2\. Frame Setup (Per Side)**

Since you have 6 frames per side (instead of Thorsen's 5), we will use the 6th position for a dedicated Frame Feeder. This is critical because **constant feeding** is the fuel for this factory.  
**Layout (From Center Divider Outwards):**

1. **Frame 1 (Center):** Brood / Foundation  
2. **Frame 2:** Brood / Foundation  
3. **Frame 3:** Brood / Foundation  
4. **Frame 4:** Brood / Foundation  
5. **Frame 5:** Pollen/Stores  
6. **Frame 6 (Outer Wall):** **Large Frame Feeder (holding 3-4 Liters)**

**3\. The Strategy: The 10-Day Cycle**

Because Dadant frames are larger than the frames Thorsen uses (approx 30% larger surface area), a "2 frames up" rotation is very aggressive. The queen must lay roughly 1,500-2,000 eggs per day consistently.  
**Prerequisites:**

* **Feed:** You must keep the feeders full of 50% sugar syrup. Never let them run dry.  
* **Queens:** You need young, prolific queens (current year or previous year).

#### **Phase 1: Preparation (Late April / Early May)**

* Build up both sides of the split hive until they are bursting with bees and have filled their 5 active frames.  
* When they are full, place the Queen Excluder and the **Upper Deck (Deep Box)** on top.

#### **Operation 1 (Day 0 \- e.g., May 15\)**

* **Goal:** Move brood out of the queen's way to prevent swarming and force new wax production.  
* **Action (Repeat for East and West sides):**  
  1. Go to the **Bottom Box**.  
  2. Find the Queen and ensure she is safe (put her on a frame near the divider temporarily).  
  3. Select **2 Frames of Sealed/Capped Brood** (Frames 2 and 4 usually).  
  4. Move these 2 frames UP to the **Upper Deck**.  
  5. In the **Bottom Box**, insert **2 Frames of Foundation** into the empty slots (positions 2 and 4).  
  6. Place the Queen back in the bottom.  
  7. Fill the Feeder.

#### **Operation 2 (Day 10 \- e.g., May 25\)**

* **Goal:** Rotate laying space.  
* **Action:**  
  1. Go to the **Bottom Box**.  
  2. Check the foundation you put in 10 days ago. It should be drawn wax and filled with eggs/larvae.  
  3. Take these 2 "fresh brood" frames and move them UP to the **Upper Deck**.  
  4. *Organization in Top Deck:* Push older sealed brood to the outside, put fresh brood in the center.  
  5. In the **Bottom Box**, insert **2 NEW Frames of Foundation**.  
  6. Fill the Feeder.

#### **Operation 3 (Day 20 \- e.g., June 4\) \- HARVEST DAY**

* **Goal:** Production of Nucs.  
* **Status:** The brood you moved up on Day 0 (20 days ago) is now ready to emerge.  
* **Action:**  
  1. Go to the **Upper Deck**.  
  2. Remove the 2 oldest frames of sealed brood (the ones from Day 0). They are now "instant bee bombs."  
  3. **Create your Nuc:** Take these 2 Dadant frames \+ 1 frame of food \+ a new Queen/Cell.  
     * *Dadant Note:* 2 full Dadant frames of emerging brood is equivalent to a very strong 3-4 frame Langstroth nuc.  
  4. **Rotate:** Perform the standard rotation (Move 2 fresh brood frames up from bottom; put 2 foundation down in bottom).

**Repeat "Operation 3" every 10 days until late July.**

**5\. Dadant-Specific Adjustments & Estimates**

Thorsen’s paper uses smaller frames. You are using massive Dadant frames. This changes the math slightly.  
**1\. Cell Count & Population:**

* A standard Dadant deep frame has approx **8,500 \- 9,000 cells** (if fully laid).  
* Thorsen’s frames have approx 6,000 cells.  
* **Impact:** Your 2-frame harvest contains roughly **14,000 to 16,000 potential bees**. This is a massive amount of bees for a single nuc.

**2\. The Danger of "Burnout":**

* Asking a queen to fill 2 Dadant sheets with eggs every 10 days is demanding. She needs to lay \~1,800 eggs/day without pause.  
* **Adjustment:** If you see the queen is lagging (foundation is drawn but not fully laid), switch to a **1-Frame Rotation** for one cycle. Move 1 up, 1 down. This gives her a break.

**3\. Wax Production:**

* Dadant frames require a lot of wax to draw.  
* **Crucial:** You must feed aggressively. If they don't draw the foundation in the bottom box within 3-4 days, the queen has nowhere to lay, and she will become honey-bound or prepare to swarm.

### **Summary of Steps for Your Hive**

1. **Split** your 12-frame Dadant with a solid vertical board.  
2. **Drill** entrances on opposite short sides (East/West).  
3. **Install** two deep boxes (one on top of the other) separated by an excluder.  
4. **Feed** 50% syrup in frame feeders in slot \#6 of both decks (or just bottom if capacity allows).  
5. **Cycle:** Every 10 days, lift 2 brood frames from bottom to top; push 2 foundation frames into bottom.  
6. **Harvest:** Every 10 days (starting Day 20), remove top sealed brood to sell or make new hives.

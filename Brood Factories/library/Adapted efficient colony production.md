This is an excellent logistical improvement. Using **two independent 6-frame nucleus boxes** as the upper chambers offers significant ergonomic advantages: you are lifting lighter boxes (approx. 15-20kg fully loaded) rather than a massive 40kg+ deep super, and you can manage one side without vibrating or disturbing the other.  
Here is the **Thorsen Strategy** adapted for your **Split Dadant Deep \+ Dual Nuc** configuration.

### **1\. The Hardware Configuration**

Your setup effectively creates two completely independent "Biological Factories" that happen to share a ground floor wall for heat conservation.

#### **The Engine Room (Bottom)**

* **Box:** Standard 12-Frame Dadant Deep.  
* **Divider:** A solid, bee-tight vertical partition board in the exact center.  
* **Entrances:**  
  * **East Side:** Entrance cut into the short rim or floor.  
  * **West Side:** Entrance cut into the opposing short rim or floor.  
* **Excluder:** A single 12-frame metal queen excluder (or two separate ones) placed over the brood box. The partition board *must* sit flush with the excluder to prevent queens from crossing under or over.

#### **The Upper Deck (The Harvest Zones)**

* **Boxes:** Two separate 6-frame Dadant Nucleus boxes.  
* **Placement:** These sit side-by-side on top of the excluder, perfectly covering the footprint of the bottom 12-frame box.  
* **Feeder:** Each nuc box and each bottom compartment requires a feeding solution. The most robust method for this high-intensity system is a **Frame Feeder** occupying position \#6 in every box (top and bottom).

**3\. The Strategy: The 10-Day Production Cycle**

**Pre-Requisites:**

* **Feed:** The "Engine" (Bottom) needs fuel to draw wax. The "Nursery" (Top) needs fuel to keep the brood warm. Keep feeders topped up with 50% syrup.  
* **Timing:** Start "Operation 1" when the bottom box is full (typically mid-May).

#### **The 10-Day Workflow (Repeat for East and West)**

**Step 1: Harvest (Top Nucs)**

1. Open the **East Top Nuc**.  
2. Identify the **2 oldest frames** of sealed brood (placed there 20 days ago).  
3. **Harvest:** Remove these 2 frames. Shake off the bees *if* you need them to stay in the factory, OR keep the bees on if you are making instant walk-away splits.  
   * *Note:* Since Dadant frames are large, 2 frames of emerging Dadant brood is a massive population boost.  
4. Consolidate the remaining frames in the Top Nuc to the center.

**Step 2: Rotation (The Lift)**

1. Lift the **East Top Nuc** off the stack and set it aside.  
2. Open the **East Bottom Split**.  
3. Find the Queen. Isolate her briefly.  
4. Remove **2 frames of fresh brood** (eggs/larvae laid in the last 10 days).  
   * *Tip:* These will be on the foundation you inserted 10 days ago.  
5. **Insert 2 frames of FRESH Foundation** into the gaps (positions 2 and 4).  
6. Release Queen.  
7. Replace the Excluder.

**Step 3: Reload**

1. Put the **East Top Nuc** back on the stack.  
2. Insert the **2 fresh brood frames** (from the bottom) into the empty space in the Top Nuc.  
3. Fill the Frame Feeders (Top and Bottom).  
4. Close the hive.

*(Repeat identical process for the West Unit).*

**4\. Critical Adjustments for Dadant Deep**

Since you are using Dadant Deep frames (which are roughly 30% larger than the frames Thorsen used), you must be careful with the "Draw Rate."

The Wax Bottleneck

In a 10-day cycle, you are asking the bees to draw out 2 full sheets of Dadant deep foundation. This is a heavy workload.

* **If the flow is slow:** They might only draw 1.5 frames.  
* **Risk:** If they don't draw the comb, the queen has nowhere to lay, and she will swarm.  
* **Solution:** You *must* feed heavily (1-2 Liters every few days) if there is no strong nectar flow. Wax production requires massive caloric intake.

The "Burnout" Management

If you find your queens cannot keep up with filling 2 huge Dadant frames every 10 days:

* **Switch to a 1-Frame Cycle:** Move 1 frame up, put 1 foundation down.  
* **Result:** You harvest 1 frame every 10 days (3 frames per month per side \= 6 frames total per month). This is still highly productive but less stressful on the colony.

### **5\. Why this "Dual Nuc" Setup is Superior**

1. **Thermal Efficiency:** The bottom queens share heat through the divider, accelerating spring buildup. The top nucs, being narrower (6 frames), are easier for the bees to keep warm than a wide 12-frame super, aiding brood maturation.  
2. **Ergonomics:** You never have to lift a full 12-frame deep box. You only lift 6-frame nucs.  
3. **Versatility:** If you need to sell a colony, you can literally sell the top box as an "Overwintered Nuc" (if you put a bottom board on it) and simply replace the box on the stack.  
4. **Risk Mitigation:** If the East Queen fails, the West unit continues uninterrupted. You can then use a brood frame from West to re-queen East effortlessly.
